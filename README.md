# Kahu! 
In hawain, they don't call a dog a dog, or a pet. 
They call it Kahu. Kahu has many meanings, some of which are Guardian, Protector, Steward, Beloverd attendant, and basically, someone entrusted for the safekeeping of something precious. 

This is my sweet letter to Spike and what I want as an owner for Spike. This is an experimental piece where I want to try exploring App Development, developing using Apple Developer tools, and Learning Go. 

Some capabilities I hope to add:
### Image Capabilities and Streak System
- Photo Streak Tracker: Every time you take a photo of Spike, the streak count increases. Add fun streak milestones like "10 days in a row!" or "100 photos taken!" with celebratory animations.
- Image Storage: Store images in a non-SQL database like Firebase or MongoDB for scalability.
- Photo Gallery: A timeline or grid view showcasing all the photos taken, with tags for events (e.g., "Bath Time," "Fetch").
- AI/Artvision Integration: Apply fun filters like “Cartoonify Spike,” “Spike in Space,” or “Watercolor Spike.”


### Reminders and Notifications
- Set recurring reminders for food, bath, grooming, vet appointments, and playtime.
- Option to snooze or mark as done.
- Interactive Notifications: Include actionable buttons like "Mark as Done" or "Snooze for 10 minutes."
- Behavioural Tracking: Track when reminders are completed. For example, "Spike's grooming streak: 3 months in a row!"


### Interactive Loading Animations
- While the app is loading data, display fun prompts like: “Did you pet Spike today?”, “Don’t forget to refill Spike’s water bowl!”, “How about a quick game of fetch?”

### Personalized Profile Page
- Profile Details: Spike’s name, breed, age, birthday, and weight.
- Editable bio section: "Spike loves chasing squirrels and belly rubs!"

### Achievements Section: 
- Track milestones like "First Bath," "100 Walks," or "Spike's Birthday Party."
- Health Tracking: Log vaccination records, medical history, and dietary preferences.
